## What is this?



## What is JavaScript?

Javascript is a programming language which was designed originally for adding interactivity to web pages.  

Without Javascript, a webpage can't change once it has arrived in your browser, every click requires that your browser go to the server and get a whole new page. So slow.

With Javascript, a webpage can react to your actions and change itself without having to reload the entire page every time.  

A nice example of this is [Google Maps](https://www.google.com.au/maps).  After it loads the first time you can click an scroll around the map,  switch between satellite and map view, even go into Street View, all without it causing the page to reload.  

## Why learn JavaScript?

Learning Javascript is a good idea for so many reasons.

Firstly, it's a core part of the modern web.  Almost all highly interactive web sites make heavy use of JavaScript to drive their UI in someway.  If you are interested in building the frontend user experience, JavaScript is a requirement.

Second, with the advent of Node.js it is possible to also use JavaScript to create both server-side and desktop applications.

And third, tools like Cordova and React Native make it possible to also build mobile applications with JavaScript.

It's increasingly the case that if you ask "Can I do that with Javascript?", the answer is yes.

Javascript isn't going anywhere, and the demand for developers with Javascript skills will only continue to grow. 

<!-- And for those who already work in other languages,  Javascript has some advanced features that are relatively rare in other languages.  Learning to program with these can really change your perspective.  These include first-class functions, prototype-base inheritence, and closures.  While we won't be covering these you will still need to cover the basics first. -->


<!-- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is an open source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime that breaks Javascript out of the confines of the browser and lets you write and run Javascript applications on the server and on your desktop. 

In addition to server-side applications Node.js has also enabled a new generation of development tools for Javascript such as [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), desktop platforms like [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/), as well as a thriving [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) ecosystem of 3rd-party open source packages for every task your could imagine.

And it's non-blocking event-driven I/O model makes it fast.  Really fast.

[Express](http://expressjs.com/) is one of the most widely-used Node.js web frameworks. Express helps you to create web applications easily by providing many conveniences on top of the fantastic foundataion provided by Node.js

So now you can write your backend services in Javascript, your website frontend  in Javascript, desktop tools, and automation as well.

The future is obviously written in Javascript, so the better question is: Why not Node.js? -->

## What will we be doing?


## Prerequisites

For beginners, it's great because it's easy to get started.  You don't need to learn any specialised, complicated tools.  All you need is the browser you already have.  

<!-- We have tried our best to make the workshop beginner friendly.

Previous experience with Javascript, Express.js, or Node.js is useful but **not necessary** for this workshop. 

You won't be writing any front-end code in this workshop, so some experience with HTML, CSS & front-end Javascript would be helpful but would be useful.

There will be lightning talks help during the day to elaborate on several technical topics to make you more familiar to the concepts. -->

## Workshop Structure

<!-- This workshop is divided into a number of steps. At the end of each step, you will 
find a link to continue onto the next step.  

After the final step we have some bonus challenge steps to test you.

Then we have some links to resources to  continue your studies.

You will see code snippets throughout the walkthrough. Try to resist the urge to copy and 
paste - you will learn much more if you get into the habit of typing things out.

Throughout each step, we have **bolded** any jargon that you may or may not be familiar 
with. These terms are explained in the Keywords section at the bottom 
of each page. You'll also find a link to our cheatsheets and other references in the Useful Links section at the bottom. -->
